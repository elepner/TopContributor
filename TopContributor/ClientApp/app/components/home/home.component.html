            PowelUI is a tailor-made library of powerful user interface components, behaviors and
            utilities for the responsive and modern day web. It provides you
            with a set of reusable building blocks that establish an extensible design system.
            These building blocks can be assembled to form user interfaces of multiple web applications.

            <strong>PowelUI is everything you need to get started building UI at Powel</strong>. It serves both developers and designers.
            It enables the former to implement consistent user interfaces much faster using a range of pre-built components,
            while the latter can quickly compose new prototypes by selecting existing materials—without getting lost in specifics.
            It's a huge win for reduced dev and design effort.
