The goal of this app is to gather information about organization's repositories changes in one place for further analysis.
Now the main idea is getting fun of ASP.NET Core/Angular2/etc. Later I think it will be possible to carry out some ML or something like that to find hidden dependencies.
E.g. correlation between commit message and commiter age, who left the longest commit messages front or back end developers and so on.

## This application consists of:

*   Client made in Angular2
*   Server made in ASP.NET Core
*   Console crawler for populating DB
*   Gerrit implementation of the crawler. Github API support is planned
