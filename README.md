The goal of this app is to gather information about organization's repositories commits in one place for further analysis.
Now the main idea is to get fun of ASP.NET Core/Angular2/etc. Later I think it will be possible to carry out some ML or something like that to find out hidden dependencies.
E.g. correlation between a commit message and the commiter age, who leaves the longest commit messages front or back end developers and so on.

## This application consists of:

*   Client made in Angular2
*   Server made in ASP.NET Core with EF.Core ORM
*   Console crawler for populating DB
*   Gerrit implementation of the crawler. Github API support is planned
